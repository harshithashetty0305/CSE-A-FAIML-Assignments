# Comparison of Normal Distributions with Different Standard Deviations


# 1. Introduction

In probability theory and statistics, the Normal Distribution (also known as Gaussian Distribution) is one of the most fundamental continuous probability distributions. It plays a central role in statistical inference, hypothesis testing, quality control, economics, engineering, and data science.

A normal distribution is completely determined by two parameters:

Mean (μ) — Measure of central tendency

Standard Deviation (σ) — Measure of dispersion

In this assignment, we analyze and compare three normal distributions that share the same mean (μ = 55) but differ in standard deviation (σ = 4, 10, 15). The objective is to determine which distribution is more stable, consistent, and statistically preferable under different conditions.

Here, we compare three classes:

* Class 4A (σ = 4)
* Class 4B (σ = 10)
* Class 4C (σ = 15)

All three classes have the same mean score (μ = 55), but they differ in their standard deviation. Using the Normal Distribution and the Empirical Rule, we analyze which class performs better and why.


# 2. Given Data

## 2.1 Mean (μ)

Mean score for all classes:

μ = 55

This means the average marks scored by students in each class is 55.

## 2.2 Standard Deviation (σ)

Standard deviation measures how spread out the marks are from the mean.

* Class 4A → σ = 4
* Class 4B → σ = 10
* Class 4C → σ = 15

Although the average marks are the same, the variation in marks differs significantly.


# 3. Understanding Standard Deviation in Academic 

Standard deviation indicates consistency.

* Low standard deviation → Students perform similarly.
* High standard deviation → Marks vary widely among students.

In an academic environment, consistency is often preferred because it indicates uniform understanding of concepts across students.


# 4. Application of Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)

The Empirical Rule states:

* 68% of data lies within 1σ of the mean.
* 95% lies within 2σ.
* 99.7% lies within 3σ.

Let us apply this to each class.


# 5. Comparison of Classes 4A, 4B, and 4C Using Mean and Standard Deviation

## 1. Same Mean for All Classes

All three classes have the same mean value (μ = 55), indicating that the average performance of students in classes 4A, 4B, and 4C is equal. Therefore, the mean alone cannot be used to determine which class is better.

## 2. Meaning of Standard Deviation

Standard deviation measures the dispersion of data values around the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the values are closely clustered around the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates greater variation in the data.

## 3. Performance Range of Class 4A (μ ± σ)

For Class 4A:

[
μ ± σ = 55 ± 4 = 51 \text{ to } 59
]

This shows that most students in Class 4A score between 51 and 59. The range is narrow, indicating high consistency and uniform performance among students.

## 4. Performance Range of Class 4B (μ ± σ)

For Class 4B:

[
μ ± σ = 55 ± 10 = 45 \text{ to } 65
]

This indicates that most students in Class 4B score between 45 and 65. The range is wider than Class 4A, showing moderate variation in performance.

## 5. Performance Range of Class 4C (μ ± σ)

For Class 4C:

[
μ ± σ = 55 ± 15 = 40 \text{ to } 70
]

This means that students in Class 4C score between 40 and 70. Although some students score high marks (up to 70), many students also score low marks, indicating high variation and inconsistent performance.

## 6. Comparison Based on Consistency

* Class 4A has the smallest range (51–59) and the least variation.
* Class 4B has a moderate range (45–65).
* Class 4C has the widest range (40–70), showing maximum variation.

When the mean of all classes is the same, the class with the minimum standard deviation is considered the best. Hence, **Class 4A** is the best class because it shows maximum consistency and minimum variation around the mean value of 55.


# 6. Graphical Interpretation

In the above graph of normal distribution curves:

* Class 4A will have a tall and narrow bell curve.
* Class 4B will have a moderately wide curve.
* Class 4C will have a very wide and flat curve.

A narrow curve indicates high consistency.
A wider curve indicates high variability.


# 7. Comparative Evaluation

## 7.2 Risk of Low Performance

Higher standard deviation increases the probability of very low scores.

Class 4C has the highest risk of poor performance.

## 7.3 Teaching Effectiveness Indicator

Lower variation often suggests:

* Effective teaching methods
* Uniform understanding among students
* Balanced academic environment

Thus, Class 4A shows better academic stability.


# 8. Which Class is Better?

Although all classes have the same mean score (55), the better class is the one with lower variability.

Class 4A (σ = 4) is better because:

* Student performance is consistent.
* Very few extreme low scores.
* Stable academic outcome.
* Better predictability of results.

Class 4B is average in terms of consistency.

Class 4C shows high inequality in student performance and therefore is less stable.


# 9. Conclusion

When comparing classes with the same mean but different standard deviations, the class with the smallest standard deviation is considered better in terms of consistency and stability.

Since:

* μ = 55 for all classes
* σ4A = 4
* σ4B = 10
* σ4C = 15

Class 4A performs better overall because student marks are closely concentrated around the mean.

This analysis demonstrates that mean alone is not sufficient to evaluate performance. Standard deviation plays a critical role in understanding data distribution and consistency.
