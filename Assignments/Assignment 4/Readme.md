# Comparison of Normal Distributions with Different Standard Deviations


# 1. Introduction

In probability theory and statistics, the Normal Distribution (also known as Gaussian Distribution) is one of the most fundamental continuous probability distributions. It plays a central role in statistical inference, hypothesis testing, quality control, economics, engineering, and data science.

A normal distribution is completely determined by two parameters:

Mean (μ) — Measure of central tendency

Standard Deviation (σ) — Measure of dispersion

In this assignment, we analyze and compare three normal distributions that share the same mean (μ = 55) but differ in standard deviation (σ = 4, 10, 15). The objective is to determine which distribution is more stable, consistent, and statistically preferable under different conditions.

Here, we compare three classes:

* Class 4A (σ = 4)
* Class 4B (σ = 10)
* Class 4C (σ = 15)

All three classes have the same mean score (μ = 55), but they differ in their standard deviation. Using the Normal Distribution and the Empirical Rule, we analyze which class performs better and why.


# 2. Given Data

## 2.1 Mean (μ)

Mean score for all classes:

μ = 55

This means the average marks scored by students in each class is 55.

## 2.2 Standard Deviation (σ)

Standard deviation measures how spread out the marks are from the mean.

* Class 4A → σ = 4
* Class 4B → σ = 10
* Class 4C → σ = 15

Although the average marks are the same, the variation in marks differs significantly.


# 3. Understanding Standard Deviation in Academic 

Standard deviation indicates consistency.

* Low standard deviation → Students perform similarly.
* High standard deviation → Marks vary widely among students.

In an academic environment, consistency is often preferred because it indicates uniform understanding of concepts across students.


# 4. Application of Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)

The Empirical Rule states:

* 68% of data lies within 1σ of the mean.
* 95% lies within 2σ.
* 99.7% lies within 3σ.

Let us apply this to each class.


# 5. Class-wise Analysis

## 5.1 Class 4A (σ = 4)

### 68% Range (μ ± 1σ)

55 ± 4 → 51 to 59

This means 68% of students scored between 51 and 59.

### 95% Range (μ ± 2σ)

55 ± 8 → 47 to 63

### 99.7% Range (μ ± 3σ)

55 ± 12 → 43 to 67

### Interpretation

Marks are closely clustered around 55. Very few students scored extremely low or extremely high. This indicates strong consistency and uniform performance.


## 5.2 Class 4B (σ = 10)

### 68% Range (μ ± 1σ)

55 ± 10 → 45 to 65

### 95% Range (μ ± 2σ)

55 ± 20 → 35 to 75

### 99.7% Range (μ ± 3σ)

55 ± 30 → 25 to 85

### Interpretation

Marks are more spread out compared to Class 4A. Some students perform very well while some perform poorly. This indicates moderate variability in understanding.


## 5.3 Class 4C (σ = 15)

### 68% Range (μ ± 1σ)

55 ± 15 → 40 to 70

### 95% Range (μ ± 2σ)

55 ± 30 → 25 to 85

### 99.7% Range (μ ± 3σ)

55 ± 45 → 10 to 100

### Interpretation

Marks are highly spread out. There are very high scorers and very low scorers. This indicates large inequality in performance levels.


# 6. Graphical Interpretation

If we draw three normal distribution curves:

* Class 4A will have a tall and narrow bell curve.
* Class 4B will have a moderately wide curve.
* Class 4C will have a very wide and flat curve.

A narrow curve indicates high consistency.
A wider curve indicates high variability.


# 7. Comparative Evaluation

## 7.1 Consistency

* Most consistent: Class 4A
* Moderate consistency: Class 4B
* Least consistent: Class 4C

## 7.2 Risk of Low Performance

Higher standard deviation increases the probability of very low scores.

Class 4C has the highest risk of poor performance.

## 7.3 Teaching Effectiveness Indicator

Lower variation often suggests:

* Effective teaching methods
* Uniform understanding among students
* Balanced academic environment

Thus, Class 4A shows better academic stability.


# 8. Which Class is Better?

Although all classes have the same mean score (55), the better class is the one with lower variability.

Class 4A (σ = 4) is better because:

* Student performance is consistent.
* Very few extreme low scores.
* Stable academic outcome.
* Better predictability of results.

Class 4B is average in terms of consistency.

Class 4C shows high inequality in student performance and therefore is less stable.


# 9. Conclusion

When comparing classes with the same mean but different standard deviations, the class with the smallest standard deviation is considered better in terms of consistency and stability.

Since:

* μ = 55 for all classes
* σ4A = 4
* σ4B = 10
* σ4C = 15

Class 4A performs better overall because student marks are closely concentrated around the mean.

This analysis demonstrates that mean alone is not sufficient to evaluate performance. Standard deviation plays a critical role in understanding data distribution and consistency.
