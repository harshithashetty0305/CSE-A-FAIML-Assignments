## 2. Theoretical Foundations (1940s–1950s)

### 2.1 Early Computational Models (1943)

The foundations of AI began with the development of mathematical models of artificial neurons. Researchers proposed models that simulated how biological neurons function. This work laid the groundwork for neural networks and machine learning.

### 2.2 The Turing Test (1950)

The Turing Test was proposed in 1950 by British mathematician Alan Turing as a way to determine whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior similar to a human. In his paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing suggested that instead of asking whether machines can think, we should ask whether a machine can imitate human responses convincingly. 

In the test, a human evaluator communicates with both a machine and a human through text, without knowing which is which. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human based on their answers, the machine is said to have passed the test. The Turing Test became one of the earliest and most influential concepts in Artificial Intelligence, shaping future discussions about machine intelligence and human-like behavior.

### 2.3 Dartmouth Conference (1956)

The Dartmouth Conference, held in 1956 at Dartmouth College, is considered the official birth of Artificial Intelligence as a formal field of study. Organized by researchers including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, the conference introduced the term “Artificial Intelligence” for the first time. 

The participants proposed that human intelligence could be precisely described and simulated by machines. This event brought together leading scientists to discuss machine learning, reasoning, and problem-solving, laying the foundation for decades of AI research and development.
